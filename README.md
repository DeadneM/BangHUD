# BangHUD (a RAID World War II BLT mod)

This HUD addition lets you focus on your health, stamina and revives left by showing it in the screen's center (in addition to the vanilla HUD), where your eyes are much more likely to keep track of them.

To not actually block your vision, there are several options like transparency and exact positioning.

Should be compatible with pretty much any other HUD mod out there, since it's an extra panel layer and does not replace or depend on vanilla HUD panels.
